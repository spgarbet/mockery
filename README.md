The purpose of Mockery is to quickly mock any endpoint called by a server with a canned response. This has value for full regression testing, when the response is known.

```
make
./_rel/mockery_release/bin/mockery_release console
```

##The Massive To Do List


### /mockery Tabs
1. Instructions and Log, updated via async javascript
   1. Log include URI requested, and Hash Delivered
   2. Log includes, mock responses created
   3. It's a rolling log of 20 events
2. Current Routes, updated when tab is selected
   1. Scans local file system, and shows all Verb, URI -> Hashed Response
   2. If the Verb is POST or PUT it is clickable to display the body of request
   3. The Hash value is clickable to display the actual response
3. Create Route,
   Verb         : GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, HEAD
   URI          : a fully qualified URI
   Status       : HTTP status of response
   Content-Type : Content type of response (Can be omitted, freeform text, but has defaults)
   Request      : Body of Request (only available to PUT and POST)
   Response     : Mocked Response 

   1. GET, can be partial based on header 'Content-Range: bytes 1000-3979/3980'
   2. HEAD is a GET request, with no body
   3. POST, PUT, and PATCH have data in request body

   When create is clicked. Hashed and written to file system.
   If it alrady exists, a warning appears, allowing "Abort" or "Overwrite"


A SHA1 Hash of Verb + URI + {Request} is used for locally storing response.

First two characters will be directory under <project>/mocks. Remaining will be file containing JSON.

Actual reserved routes

/mockery => The main tabs, an internal asset that is mocked. Yes, the application is post-modern.
/mockery/log => Log callback => JSON
/mockery/routes => all the routes in  JSON
/mockery/routes/[Hash] => returns JSON {verb, uri, request, status, request, response}

Any other URI is hashed to get status/response from filesystem.

### Open questions
* How to store binary objects for response?
* How do we store logs?
* What should be logged?
